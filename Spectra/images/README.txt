HOW TO REPLACE PLACEHOLDER IMAGES

1. The images folder contains placeholder files (prefab1.jpg through prefab6.jpg) that need to be replaced with your actual prefabricated structure images.

2. To replace the images:
   - Rename your images to match the placeholder filenames (prefab1.jpg, prefab2.jpg, etc.)
   - Copy your renamed images to this folder, overwriting the placeholder files
   - Alternatively, you can keep your original filenames and update the src attributes in the index.html file

3. Image assignments:
   - prefab1.jpg: Prefabricated Factory Shed (first image in the products section)
   - prefab2.jpg: Prefabricated Site Office (second image)
   - prefab3.jpg: Portable Toilet (third image)
   - prefab4.jpg: Portable Security Cabin (fourth image)
   - prefab5.jpg: Prefabricated Workmen Colony (fifth image)
   - prefab6.jpg: Prefabricated Isolation Ward (sixth image)

4. For best results, ensure your images are properly sized and optimized for web display.
